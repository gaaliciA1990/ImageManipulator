# Image Processor

A simple Image Processor API that accepts a byte array image and can process the image as follows: 
- Rotate 90 degrees left or right
- Rotate any degrees
- Flip horizontally or vertically
- Add a grayscale filter
- Resize an image by width and/or height based on pixel size
- Create a 160x108 pixel thumbnail

## Tools and Libraries
Ktor Framework
[Sketch Library](https://github.com/reugn/sketch/tree/main) and the 
[Scrimage Library](https://github.com/sksamuel/scrimage) to process images in different ways. 


## API Documentation
